# Customer Churn Prediction

This project involves predicting whether a customer is likely to churn using a machine learning model trained on customer behavior data.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- Public Telco Customer dataset from OpenML.
- Features include tenure, services subscribed, charges, contract type, and more.

## ðŸ”§ Techniques Used
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (null handling, encoding)
- Feature engineering
- Model training using Random Forest Classifier
- Model evaluation using confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1 score
- Feature importance visualization

## ðŸ“ˆ Output
The model identifies key features that affect churn and achieves high classification accuracy.

## ðŸ›  Tools
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
